# Bengaluru-House-Price-Predictor-Model
<p>In this project, a Machine Learning Model is trained on the basis of a dataset present on Kaggle. This dataset is about the house prices in Bengaluru. The model predics the price of a house based on certain parameters as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location</li>
  <li>Area Type</li>
  <li>Total Square feet of the house</li>
  <li>Number of Bathrooms</li>
  <li>Number of Balconies</li>
  <li>BHK</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a basic project that I made to understand the implementation of the basics of Machine Learning.</p>
<p>This repository contains the initial dataset, the final dataset after data cleaning and the programming part of this process and data cleaning</p>
